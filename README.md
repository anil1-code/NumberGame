# How to play
1. You are given 6 turns.
2. In each turn you can drop some amount between x (0 < x <= 10).
3. This amount will be taken from your current score which was initially 0, and if she grants you this wish then 2x will be added to your score, 
otherwise nothing will change in your score
Example, in current turn lets say your score is s and you drop x, then your score will become s - x and if she grants you this wish then it will add 2x to 
your score otherwise nothing will change, so final score will become s - x + 2x = s + x and s - x + 0 = s - x respectively.
4. She has to grant your wish at least 3 times by the end of 6 turns and game will choose this 3 wishes to minimise your final score and your task is to maximise your score
